# Draw-It-or-Lose-It
A game from the Gaming Room. Work done through my Operating Platforms course - CS 230

The Gaming Room client developed an Android-based game and they want to bring their game to a web-based environment which requires the use of other languages and tools. The game requires unique identities for the players and teams which demands a huge focus on security to ensure those stay unique. The game also store a lot of images which requires a lot of storage space. 

Overall, I believe I did a good job with assessing the client's needs and identifying what would be required. When working through the design document, I found it helpful to review the different operating systems and the different patterns that can be useful in those operating systems. Although, if I could choose one document to revise, it would be the evaluation. I would do more research on the different operating platforms to perform a better analysis. I interpreted the user's needs by listening to what they had to say and applied what I learned from the course to find efficient ways to implement them. I appraoched the design for this software by incorporating the different patterns and while keeping the security principles in mind. In the future, I'd like to incorporate more strategies surrounding security.
